# Hypertext Markup Language

* Standard markup language for Web pages.
* Markup is built using tags.

## Document Type

* The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration must be the first, before the `<html>` tag.
* The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is not an HTML tag; it instructs the browser the version of HTML.

## HTML Tag

* The `<html>` tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
* The `<html>` tag represents the root of an HTML document.
* The `<html>` tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the `<!DOCTYPE>` tag).

## Head Tag

* The `<head>` element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the `<html>` tag and the `<body>` tag.
* HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
* Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.

## Body Tag

* The `<body>` tag defines the document's body.
* The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.

## HTML Attributes

* All HTML elements can have attributes
* Attributes provide additional information about an element
* Attributes are always specified in the start tag
* Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: `name="value"`
